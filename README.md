# Animated Contact Card
The code from my video at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mFgrFcDtsxo

## How it Works
- There are 2 main classes: `fade` and `complete`.
- `fade` removes text by setting `font-size` to 0 and applies an animation that oscillates the background colour between a light gray and a dark gray.
- Once data has been fetched (I faked that using a delay), set the classes of the three elements to `complete` in JavaScript.
